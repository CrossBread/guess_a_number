# Guess a Number

Remake of my first game written in QBasic when I was 12. 

The game is a simple guessing game where the player has to guess a number between 1 and a Million. 

The player has 20 tries to guess the number. After each guess, the game will tell the player if the guess was too high or too low. If the player guesses the number, the game will tell the player how many tries it took to guess the number.

There is an AI opponent playing as well.  If they guess the number before you do, you lose.  If you guess the number before they do, you win.


## Flutter updates
This version will have a visual representation of how much they have narrowed the answer space compared to the AI.


# Tasks

The actual implementaion should be as rapid as possible, not involving scalable architecture.  The end goal is to have the game hosted on a public GitHub repo page.  First we'll need basic project setup.  A scaffold for visualizing changes. Then implement the game rules in a manager class.  Test and then publish and share.
